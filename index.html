        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <h2> <u>cocoa puff </u></h2>
        <p>Welcome to my webpage</p>

        <p>This is tink, she is a dingo</p>
    <h2>Tinkerbells Quirks</h2>
    <p>Tinkerbell is unlike her native Dingo friends since she has been raised American.
         Shes not a crazy Australian as one would assume.
          Tinkerbell is afraid of men with beards, cats, vacuums, and her own reflection. </p>
          <h2>How Tinkerbell Came into My Life</h2>
          <p>One day, back in 2006, my Dad went with a friend to an animal shelter so she could adopt a dog. My dad wasn't interested in getting another pet
              as we already had a dog, cat and bunny at the house. But then he saw a dog sitting patiently in her crate, not barking unlike the rest of the orphans.
              He decided she was the one, his dog soul mate if you will.
