#### Codecademy : 
- ### Learn React.js: Part II 
  - Lifecycle Methods 
    - Updating/Unmounting Lifecycle Methods
#### Summary

#### Component Mount
A React component mounts when it renders to the DOM for the first time. If it's already mounted, a component can render again if it needs to change its appearance and content. 
#### Five updating lifecycle methods :
 -  ##### 1. componentWillReceiveProps
    - gets called before rendering begins
    - only gets called if the component will receive props
 - ##### 2. shouldComponentUpdate
    - also gets called before rendering begins
    - use to let React know if a components output is not affected by the change in state or props
 - ##### 3. componentWillUpdate
    - called before rendering
    - use this as an opportunity to perform preperation before an update occurs. 
    - is typically replaced by ~ componentDidUpdate 
 - ##### 4. render
    - the only required method in a class component
 - ##### 5. componentDidUpdate
    - invoked immediately after the update occurs
    - use as an opportunity to work on the DOM aftr the component has been updated 
 
 When a component instance updates it automatically calls all 5 of these methods. In order.
 
 
 Once a component istance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again.
 
 ### Create a Front-End App With React 
  - Javascript intro and React overview
    - The **front-end** of a web application is the code that a web browser executes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, files that are rendered by the browser to create the user interface.
    - The **back-end** of a web application is the code that the server executes. The server stores the data that all of the different clients need, and it listens for requests and sends the requested data back to the client.
    - Many jobs are **front-end** focused.
